# Heap-programming-assignment
In this assignment, I wrote a program in C language that implements the scheduling system for the hairsalon. 
Each stylist can have up to 10 maximum number of clients, and each customer can either have a preferred stylist or not.
If the customer has no preference, they will be put to the stylist with the lowest number of clients in a line.
If there is the same number of customers for all stylists, the customer will be put to the stylist with the lowest number of the station of the stylist.
If the customer does have a preference, they will be put to that stylist no matter how many clients there are.
And, if the stylist the customer chose is not working at the moment, the rule with no preference will take place instead.
